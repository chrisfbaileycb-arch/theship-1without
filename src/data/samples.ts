## Objective
Enable seamless offline mutations in a Progressive Web Application with background sync registration, IndexedDB conflict resolution, and Push notification receipts.

## Step-by-Step Execution Sequence:
1. Register Service Worker at '/sw.js' with scope '/' and verify navigator.serviceWorker.controller is active.
2. Initialize client-side IndexedDB store 'outbox_mutations' with auto-incrementing keyPath 'id' and timestamp index.
3. Intercept offline POST/PUT form submissions, serialize payload into IndexedDB outbox, and update UI state optimistically.
4. Register background sync tag 'sync-outbox-mutations' via window.SyncManager when network connectivity status changes to offline.
5. In Service Worker 'sync' event handler, drain 'outbox_mutations' queue sequentially by sending batch POST requests to '/api/v1/sync/batch'.
6. Verify server responds with HTTP 200 and array of committed transaction IDs; remove confirmed items from IndexedDB outbox.
7. PostMessage 'SYNC_COMPLETE' event to all active window clients and display toast notification verifying cloud state convergence.`,

2. Redact all debtor Social Security Numbers, employer tax identification numbers, and non-party individual identifiers using 1WithOut Privacy Scrubber.
3. Extract Schedule E (Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims) and Schedule F (Unsecured Nonpriority Claims) tables into structured JSON schemas.
4. Cross-reference creditor claim amounts against state UCC-1 lien filings to verify perfection status and collateral description.
5. Compute aggregate priority vs nonpriority exposure, flag disputed or unliquidated claims, and calculate estimated distribution waterfall percentages.
6. Generate formatted Chapter 11 disclosure statement exhibit table and compile validation audit hash for attorney review.`,

## Architectural Baseline:
- **Client Architecture**: React 19 PWA, Tailwind CSS, Motion UI, Web App Manifest (standalone display, theme-color #020617).
- **Service Worker**: Cache-First for static assets, Network-First for API with IndexedDB fallback queue.
- **Backend API**: Express TypeScript server, reverse proxy port 3000 ingress, PostgreSQL connection pool limit 10.
- **Billing & Legal**: Stripe Checkout with raw signature verification, GDPR data export/deletion routes, compliant Privacy Policy.

## 6-Pillar Launch Verification Requirements:
1. Security & Identity: CSP headers configured, zero client secret leaks, 14-day token revocation, Defense-of-Break sentinel active.
2. Infrastructure & Cloud: Port 3000 container ingress, database connection pooling, graceful unhandled rejection logging.
3. Legal, Compliance & Billing: Stripe customer portal, tax calculation, clear ToS & Privacy disclosure, no misleading claims.
4. Marketing, Copy & Claims: Factual value proposition, elimination of unprovable financial promises, transparent pricing.
5. Interface & QA: Standalone PWA installability, touch targets >=44px, WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio across dark/light mode.
6. Post-Launch Cadence: 30-day early error triage, 90-day dependency update, 180-day security & credential rotation.`,
